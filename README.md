# DANN_TO
This repository includes the coded required to reproduce the results in the paper: Neural network-based surrogate model in post-processing of topology optimized structures

These scripts require all contents of the repository to be present in the same folder. Each DANN_Explicit script must be run to generate the local variable files prior to the optimizer.
